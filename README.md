## Self Introduction
I am `Frank Steven`.  
I am a C++ learner, and I have also learned JavaScript, HTML as well as python.  
I am mostly a back end developer, sometime I also write front end.  
If you have got any good idea, you can contact me to work together. Though I will be online only for a while.
